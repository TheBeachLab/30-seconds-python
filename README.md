# 100+ short Python 3 programming exercises

Jupyter notebook inspired by [Python-programming-exercises](https://github.com/zhiwehu/Python-programming-exercises) and [30-seconds-python](https://github.com/kriadmin/30-seconds-of-python-code). A repository created to keep track of new things I learn about Python 3.

Just click on the [notebook](30-seconds-python.ipynb). Or open the notebook in an [external viewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/thebeachlab/30-seconds-python/blob/master/30-seconds-python.ipynb). Password was set to `python3`.
